**Windows Build Instructions**

## 

Pre-requisites:
* GIT client: Available from https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Microsoft Visual Studio
* ASL compiler: Available from http://www.acpica.org

Create a new directory for an EDK II WORKSPACE. 

The code block below shows the GIT clone operations required to pull the EDK II source tree, the FatPkg sources, the pre-built versions of BaseTools as WIN32 binaries, the edk2-non-osi repository that provides a binary file for the Quark Remote Management Unit (RMU).

Next it sets environment variables that must be set before running edkSetup.bat. Since content is being pulled from multiple repositories, the EDK II [Multiple Workspace](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Multiple_Workspace)
feature is used.

Next, the edkSetup.bat file is run to complete the initialization of an EDK II build environment.  Two example build commands are shown.  The first one in QuarkPlatformPlg/Quark.dsc builds a full UEFI firmware image that is able to boot the built-in UEFI Shell and Yocto Linux from a micro SD FLASH card.  The second one in QuarkPlatformPkg/QuarkMin.dsc builds a minimal firmware image that is useful for initial power-on and debug of new features.

**Build Features**

The table below contains a summary of the build flags to enable or disable features on the build command line using the ```-D``` flag.

| **Define Name**          | **Default Value**   | **Supported Values** |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| ```GALILEO```              |                GEN2 | GEN1, GEN2           |
| ```LOGGING```              |                TRUE | TRUE, FALSE          |
| ```SOURCE_DEBUG_ENABLE```  |               FALSE | TRUE, FALSE          |
| ```PERFORMANCE_ENABLE```   |               FALSE | TRUE, FALSE          |
| ```SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE```   |               FALSE | TRUE, FALSE          |
| ```MEASURED_BOOT_ENABLE``` |               FALSE | TRUE, FALSE          |
| ```TPM_12_HARDWARE```      |                NONE | NONE, LPC, ATMEL_I2C, INFINEON_I2C |

* ```GALILEO``` - Used to specify the type of Intel(R) Gaileo board type.  The default is ```GEN2``` for the [Intel(R) Galileo Gen 2 Development Board](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/embedded/products/galileo/galileo-overview.html).  The other supported value is ```GEN1``` for the [Intel(R) Galileo Development Board](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/embedded/products/galileo/galileo-g1-datasheet.html).  Add ```-D GALILEO=GEN1``` to the build command for [Intel(R) Gaileo Development Board](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/embedded/products/galileo/galileo-g1-datasheet.html).

* ```LOGGING``` - Used to enable/disable logging messages from DEBUG() macros to a serial UART.  The default is TRUE for enabled when the BUILDTARGET is DEBUG (```-b DEBUG```).  The default is FALSE for disabled when the BUILDTARGET is not DEBUG (e.g. ```-b RELEASE```).  Add ```-D LOGGING``` to the build command to force logging enabled.  Add ```-D LOGGING=FALSE``` to force logging disabled.

* ```SOURCE_DEBUG_ENABLE``` - Used to enable/disable source level debug using the [Intel(R) UDK Debugger Tool](https://firmware.intel.com/develop/intel-uefi-tools-and-utilities/intel-uefi-development-kit-debugger-tool).  The default is FALSE for disabled.  Add ```-D SOURCE_DEBUG_ENABLE``` to the build command line to enable source level debug.

* ```PERFORMANCE_ENABLE``` - Used to enable/disable boot performance measurement.  The default is FALSE for disabled.  Add ```-D PERFORMANCE_ENABLE``` to the build command line to enable boot performance measurement.  When this feature is enabled, both ```LOGGING``` and ```SOURCE_DEBUG_ENABLE``` are automatically disabled so there is not boot time overhead from the serial UART for logging messages or the debug agent.

* ```SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE``` - Used to enable/disable UEFI Secure Boot features.  The default is FALSE for disabled.  Add ```-D SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE``` to the build command line to enable UEFI Secure Boot features.

* ```MEASURED_BOOT_ENABLE``` - Used to enable/disable measurement of firmware code and data into a TPM 1.2 hardware device.  The default is FALSE for disabled.  Add ```-D MEASURED_BOOT_ENABLE``` to the build command line to enable UEFI Secure Boot features.

* ```TPM_12_HARDWARE``` - Used to specify the type of TPM 1.2 hardware device that is connected to the Galileo board.  This define is valid if the measure boot feature is enabled using ```-D MEASURED_BOOT_ENABLE```.  The default is NONE for no TPM 1.2 hardware device connected.  Add ```-D TPM_12_HARDWARE=LPC``` for a TPM hardware device attached to an LPC bus (not supported on on Intel(R) Quark SoC X1000).  Add ```-D TPM_12_HARDWARE=ATMEL_I2C``` for an [Atmel AT97SC3204T](http://www.atmel.com/devices/AT97SC3204T.aspx) or  [Atmel AT97SC3205T](http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-8883s-tpm-at97sc3205t-datasheet-summary.pdf) attached to the I2C bus of the Galileo Arduino header.  Add ```-D TPM_12_HARDWARE=INFINION_I2C``` for an [Infineon SLB9645](http://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-TPM+SLB+9645-DS-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d4625185e0e201518b83d0c63d7c) attached to the I2C bus of the Galileo Arduino header.  The ATMEL_I2C setting has been tested with the [CryptoShield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13183) available from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/).

**FLASH Update using DediProg SF100**

Once the sources have been downloaded, a build environment established, and a firmware image has been built, the firmware image needs to installed into the FLASH device on the target Galileo development board.  One way to do this is with the [Dediprog SF100 IC Programmer](http://www.dediprog.com/pd/spi-flash-solution/SF100).

* **NOTE**: You may want to read and save the current FLASH image that was shipped with the Galileo development board before updating FLASH image.
