/**
  Copies a source buffer to a destination buffer, and returns the destination buffer.

  This function copies Length bytes from SourceBuffer to DestinationBuffer, and returns
  DestinationBuffer.  The implementation must be reentrant, and it must handle the case
  where SourceBuffer overlaps DestinationBuffer.
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - DestinationBuffer + 1), then ASSERT(). 
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - SourceBuffer + 1), then ASSERT(). 

  @param  DestinationBuffer   Pointer to the destination buffer of the memory copy.
  @param  SourceBuffer        Pointer to the source buffer of the memory copy.
  @param  Length              Number of bytes to copy from SourceBuffer to DestinationBuffer.

  @return DestinationBuffer.
